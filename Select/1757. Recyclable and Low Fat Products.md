product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
low_fats is an ENUM (category) of type (&#39;Y&#39;, &#39;N&#39;) where &#39;Y&#39; means this product is low fat and &#39;N&#39; means it is not.
recyclable is an ENUM (category) of types (&#39;Y&#39;, &#39;N&#39;) where &#39;Y&#39; means this product is recyclable and &#39;N&#39; means it is not.</pre>

### Explanation of the Query

```sql
SELECT product_id
FROM Products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
```

This query retrieves the `product_id` of products from the `Products` table where both the `low_fats` and `recyclable` attributes are set to `'Y'`.

---

### Breakdown of the Query

#### 1. **`SELECT` Clause**
   - **Purpose**: Specifies which column(s) to retrieve.
   - **In Query**: 
     ```sql
     SELECT product_id
     ```
     - Retrieves the `product_id` of rows that meet the condition.

   - **Example**:
     Consider the `Products` table:

     | product_id | low_fats | recyclable |
     |------------|----------|------------|
     | 1          | 'Y'      | 'Y'        |
     | 2          | 'N'      | 'Y'        |
     | 3          | 'Y'      | 'N'        |

     The query will fetch only the `product_id` column.

---

#### 2. **`FROM` Clause**
   - **Purpose**: Indicates the table to query data from.
   - **In Query**:
     ```sql
     FROM Products
     ```
     - Specifies that data will be retrieved from the `Products` table.

---

#### 3. **`WHERE` Clause**
   - **Purpose**: Filters rows based on the given conditions.
   - **In Query**:
     ```sql
     WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y'
     ```
     - Filters rows where both:
       - The `low_fats` column has a value of `'Y'`.
       - The `recyclable` column has a value of `'Y'`.

   - **Concept**:
     - The `AND` logical operator ensures that **both conditions** are satisfied for a row to be included in the result.

   - **Example**:
     Using the `Products` table:

     | product_id | low_fats | recyclable |
     |------------|----------|------------|
     | 1          | 'Y'      | 'Y'        |
     | 2          | 'N'      | 'Y'        |
     | 3          | 'Y'      | 'N'        |

     - Row 1: `low_fats = 'Y'` AND `recyclable = 'Y'` → Included
     - Row 2: `low_fats = 'N'` AND `recyclable = 'Y'` → Excluded
     - Row 3: `low_fats = 'Y'` AND `recyclable = 'N'` → Excluded

---

### Result
For the given `Products` table, the query returns:

| product_id |
|------------|
| 1          |

---

### Summary
This query uses **data selection (`SELECT`)**, **filtering (`WHERE`)**, and a **logical operator (`AND`)** to extract specific rows that meet both conditions (`low_fats = 'Y'` and `recyclable = 'Y'`). It demonstrates how SQL can be used to perform precise filtering on data based on multiple conditions.
```sql []
Select product_id
from Products
where low_fats = 'Y' and recyclable = 'Y'
```
The query concept revolves around **filtering rows based on multiple conditions** using the **`WHERE` clause** and the logical operator **`AND`**.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Filtering Rows**:
   - The **`WHERE` clause** is used to specify conditions that rows must meet to be included in the result set.

2. **Logical Operator (`AND`)**:
   - Combines multiple conditions, ensuring **all conditions** must be true for a row to be selected.

3. **Column Comparison**:
   - Checks specific column values (`low_fats` and `recyclable`) against the specified condition (`'Y'`).

4. **Result Set**:
   - Only columns from the rows that satisfy the conditions are retrieved.

### Example Table:
| product_id | low_fats | recyclable |
|------------|----------|------------|
| 1          | 'Y'      | 'Y'        |
| 2          | 'N'      | 'Y'        |
| 3          | 'Y'      | 'N'        |

### Execution Flow:
1. Check each row:
   - Row 1: `low_fats = 'Y'` AND `recyclable = 'Y'` → Included
   - Row 2: `low_fats = 'N'` → Excluded
   - Row 3: `recyclable = 'N'` → Excluded
2. Return only the `product_id` of included rows.

**Result**: Rows matching both conditions return their `product_id`.
