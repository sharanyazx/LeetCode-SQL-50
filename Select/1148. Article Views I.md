There is no primary key (column with unique values) for this table, the table may have duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates that some viewer viewed an article (written by some author) on some date. 
Note that equal author_id and viewer_id indicate the same person.

<p>Write a solution to find all the authors that viewed at least one of their own articles.</p>

<p>Return the result table sorted by <code>id</code> in ascending order.</p>

<p>The result format is in the following example.</p>

### Query Explanation

The given query selects distinct `author_id` values from the `Views` table where the `author_id` is equal to the `viewer_id`. The results are then sorted in ascending order of the `id`.

---

### Query Breakdown

1. **`SELECT DISTINCT author_id AS id`**:
   - Retrieves unique `author_id` values from the table and renames the column as `id`.

2. **`FROM Views`**:
   - Specifies the table (`Views`) from which data will be retrieved.

3. **`WHERE author_id = viewer_id`**:
   - Filters the rows to include only those where `author_id` matches `viewer_id`.

4. **`ORDER BY id ASC`**:
   - Sorts the output in ascending order based on the `id` column.

---

### Use Case
This query is useful for identifying all authors who have viewed their own content. For example, in a social media platform, it helps track users who have interacted with their own posts.

---

### Example Table and Query Execution

#### Table: `Views`
| author_id | viewer_id | timestamp  |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| 1         | 2         | 2025-01-17 |
| 2         | 2         | 2025-01-18 |
| 3         | 3         | 2025-01-19 |
| 1         | 1         | 2025-01-20 |

#### Query Execution:
1. The `WHERE` clause filters rows where `author_id = viewer_id`.
   - Result: Rows (2, 2) and (3, 3), and (1, 1).
2. The `DISTINCT` ensures duplicate `author_id` values are removed.
   - Result: `1, 2, 3`.
3. The `ORDER BY` ensures the results are sorted in ascending order.
   - Final Output:
     ```
     +----+
     | id |
     +----+
     | 1  |
     | 2  |
     | 3  |
     +----+
     ```

### Performance Considerations

- **Indexes**:
  - If the `author_id` and `viewer_id` columns have indexes, query performance will be optimized, especially for large tables.
  
- **Distinct and Sorting**:
  - The use of `DISTINCT` and `ORDER BY` requires additional processing. In large datasets, this may result in slower query execution.

### Optimized Version (If Performance is Critical)
If the `author_id` column is already unique, the `DISTINCT` keyword might be redundant:
```sql
SELECT author_id AS id
FROM Views
WHERE author_id = viewer_id
ORDER BY author_id ASC;
```

## SQL concepts from this Query:

---

### 1. **Filtering with `WHERE` Clause**
   - **Concept**: Filters rows based on a condition.
   - **In Query**: 
     ```sql
     WHERE author_id = viewer_id
     ```
     - This ensures that only rows where the `author_id` matches the `viewer_id` are considered.

---

### 2. **Selection and Aliasing**
   - **Concept**: Specifies which columns to include in the result and renames them for better readability or clarity.
   - **In Query**:
     ```sql
     SELECT DISTINCT author_id AS id
     ```
     - `author_id` is selected and renamed as `id` for output.

---

### 3. **Removing Duplicates with `DISTINCT`**
   - **Concept**: Ensures that only unique values are included in the result.
   - **In Query**:
     ```sql
     SELECT DISTINCT author_id AS id
     ```
     - Ensures no duplicate `author_id` values are present in the result.

---

### 4. **Sorting with `ORDER BY`**
   - **Concept**: Arranges the output rows in a specific order.
   - **In Query**:
     ```sql
     ORDER BY id ASC
     ```
     - Orders the result by `id` in ascending order.

---

### 5. **Logical Equality (`=`)**
   - **Concept**: Used in the `WHERE` clause to compare two columns or values.
   - **In Query**:
     ```sql
     WHERE author_id = viewer_id
     ```
     - Checks if `author_id` is equal to `viewer_id`.

---

### 6. **Relational Database Operations**
   - This query operates on a relational database table (`Views`) where each row represents an entity with columns storing attributes (`author_id`, `viewer_id`).
