# Soluion Explanation

### Problem Explanation

The task is to retrieve the names of customers from the `Customer` table who are **not referred by the customer with `id = 2`**. 

- If `referee_id` is `NULL`, the customer was not referred by anyone, so they should be included in the result.
- If `referee_id != 2`, the customer was referred by someone other than the customer with `id = 2`, so they should also be included.

The solution query achieves this goal by using a `WHERE` clause with the conditions:

1. `referee_id IS NULL` — Includes customers without a `referee_id`.
2. `referee_id != 2` — Includes customers referred by someone other than the customer with `id = 2`.

### Query

```sql
SELECT name
FROM Customer
WHERE referee_id IS NULL OR referee_id != 2;
```

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Filter Condition:**
   - Use `WHERE referee_id IS NULL OR referee_id != 2` to identify rows where:
     - The `referee_id` is `NULL` (no referral), or
     - The `referee_id` is not `2` (referred by someone other than customer `2`).

2. **Projection:**
   - The `SELECT name` clause ensures only the `name` column is returned for the filtered rows.

3. **Result Format:**
   - The query will return the result as a single column table with the names of the qualifying customers.

### Example Walkthrough

#### Input: `Customer` Table

| id  | name   | referee_id |
|------|--------|------------|
| 1    | Will   | NULL       |
| 2    | Jane   | NULL       |
| 3    | Alex   | 2          |
| 4    | Bill   | NULL       |
| 5    | Zack   | 1          |
| 6    | Mark   | 2          |

#### Execution:

- `WHERE referee_id IS NULL`:
  - Includes: `Will`, `Jane`, and `Bill`.
- `WHERE referee_id != 2`:
  - Includes: `Zack`.

Final result includes all names: `Will`, `Jane`, `Bill`, and `Zack`.

#### Output:

| name   |
|--------|
| Will   |
| Jane   |
| Bill   |
| Zack   |

### Key Concepts:

1. **`IS NULL`:** 
   - Checks for rows where the value of `referee_id` is `NULL`.

2. **`!=` (Not Equal):** 
   - Ensures rows where `referee_id` is not equal to a specific value (in this case, `2`).

3. **`OR`:** 
   - Combines two conditions where at least one must be true for the row to be included in the result.
